 * Variables are the primary way we contain information in Javascript. Esentialy variables are just lables to encluse data assigned to that lable.
 * 1: Declaration and assignment. Declaration is how we let the computer know this word is going to be used as a variable. assignment is how we assign data to that lable. 
 * Declaration consists of a key word and the variable. The assignment then includs the variable name. If we do this in one step it is call inisalization.

 * 2: Var, let, const 
 * These are the three keywords that let the computer know we are encapsulating data with a lable.
