The two phases to using functions: First we must define the function and give it a name. Next we can execute by calling  or invoking the function 
2. What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
 The parameters are the variables listed as part of the function definition. 
 The arguments are the values passed to the function when it is called.
3. What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
var variableName = function f(){ // Code here };
4. How do we assign a function to a variable?
The syntax for assigning a function to a variable is the same as seting anyother data type to a variable. The name you want the assigment oporator followed by the function decleration.

5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
